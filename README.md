<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Jerry's Quick Mart] <a name="about-project"></a>

> In this project, I have built a solution for Jerry's market. He needed checkout software 3 days before his grand opening, so I developed an app based on OOP to receive an inventory from a .txt file and print a receipt to a new .txt with a transaction number.


## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

> I use Ruby for the whole implementation because It's the best option for an OOP-based app. And for the testing suit, I've used RSpec.
